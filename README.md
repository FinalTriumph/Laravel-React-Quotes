## Laravel practice project

Built by starting with these steps:
- https://github.com/FinalTriumph/Laravel-Simple-Auth
- https://github.com/FinalTriumph/Laravel-React

Further development of this project has been comparatively slow because of multiple reasons:
- The time available to spend on this project.
- As this is practice project, while building it, there have also been many conversations with AI (Perplexity) about "what is the best way to do this", "what are the best practices to do this", and so on, to learn more new things.

But currently it's almost finished to the point where it will be left as is.
