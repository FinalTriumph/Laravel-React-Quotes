Further development can be seen in the commit history.

#### Main functionality

**All users can:**
- View four random quotes from four different sources on the home page.
- Request a "New Quote" from each source individually.
- View "All Quotes" saved by registered users.
- View all quotes saved from a specific source.
- View all quotes saved by a specific user.
- "Login" or "Register" a new account.

**Registered users additionally can:**
- "Save" quotes displayed on the home page (each quote individually).
- View "My Quotes" (all quotes saved by the current user).
- Remove saved quotes (those saved by the current user).
- View "Profile".
- Use "Edit Profile", "Change Password", and "Delete Profile" options (deleting a profile also removes all saved quotes).

In future there may or may not be more changes. Currently, this project is considered finished.
